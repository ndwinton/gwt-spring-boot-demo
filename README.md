## GWT with Spring Boot

This is a very simple demonstration of turning a
GWT application generated by GWT WebAppCreator into
a Spring Boot application. This includes creating a
RESTful-ish equivalent of the server side of the
GWT RPC but does *not* include making the app
use that API.

It is possible to replace GWT RPC with REST calls
using [RestyGWT](https://resty-gwt.github.io/)
Although there are some commented out lines showing
the start of the changes needed to introduce this, in
the end, I decided not to pursue this route. There
seems little to be gained by just replacing GWT RPC
with REST and introducing more dependencies on
another not very actively maintained library.
